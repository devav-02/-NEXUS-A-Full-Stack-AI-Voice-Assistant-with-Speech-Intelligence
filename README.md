# 🤖 NEXUS — AI Voice Assistant (End-to-End System)

> 🚀 Built from scratch. Engineered like a system. Designed like JARVIS.

NEXUS is a full-stack AI Voice Assistant that integrates real-time speech recognition, intelligent decision making, automation, real-time search, and a custom animated GUI into a seamless, concurrent AI system.

This is not just a chatbot — it is a real-time, multi-layered voice AI architecture.
